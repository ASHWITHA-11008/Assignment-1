\textbf{Question-1.13}

From a lot of 30 bulbs which include 6 defectives, a sample of 4 bulbs is drawn at random with replacement. Find the probability distribution of the number of defective bulbs.\\

\textbf{Solution:}

Given 30 bulbs which include 6 defectives and 4 bulbs are drawn at random with replacement.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Probability distribution of the number of defective bulbs.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
No. of defective bulbs drawn & 0 & 1& 2& 3& 4\\
\hline
Probability & $\frac{24^4}{30^4}$  & $\frac{6}{30}\times\frac{24^3}{30^3}\times4$ & $\frac{6^2}{30^2}\times\frac{24^2}{30^2}\times6$ & $\frac{6^3}{30^3}\times\frac{24}{30}\times4$ & $\frac{6^4}{30^4}$\\
